## Files

This directory contains functions used by both bot and api.

1. [log.py](./log.py) — handles all logging
2. [sheets.py](./sheets.py) — handles calls to the gsheet we currently use as our database, and can be easily tweaked to link to other databases like MongoDB
3. [utils.py](./utils.py) — useful util functions
